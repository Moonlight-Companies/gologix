Many of the pre-defined types in a logix controller don't play by the same rules as UDTs or the basic atomic types.  This packge attempts to define as much about these pre defined types as is known to make them easier to work with.  Unfortunately I don't have enough detailed information about how they are done to implement using them inside UDTs.  If anyone has knowledge of how the abbreviated type code crc is calculated for a structure with a pre defined type inside it, please let me know.



I've found out that all builtin types have template instance numbers between 0x0F00 and 0xFFF.  Instead of having a "real" CRC calculated for them, they use the instance number.  The CRC string being used for the types is still based off the actual structures, but it also includes the hidden items of the templates.
